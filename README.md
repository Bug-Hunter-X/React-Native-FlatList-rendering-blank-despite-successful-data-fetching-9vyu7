# React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug where a React Native FlatList component renders blank, even when data is successfully fetched from an API. The problem is intermittent and difficult to reproduce consistently.

## Description

The `MyComponent` component fetches data from a remote API using `fetch`.  Error handling is in place, and the loading state is correctly managed. However, under certain conditions (not consistently reproducible), the FlatList remains blank, despite the `data` state containing the expected array of objects.

## Reproduction

While consistent reproduction is challenging, the issue seems related to timing or data handling within the asynchronous operations.  The provided code includes a placeholder API endpoint. Replace this with a valid endpoint for testing.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring data consistency and handling potential edge cases. The solution file provides a corrected approach.
